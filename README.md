📊 Energy Consumption Dashboard (Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

This Energy Consumption Dashboard is built using Power BI to analyze and visualize energy consumption trends across different building types. The dashboard provides key insights into energy usage patterns, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize energy efficiency.

🚀 Features & Insights

🔹 Key Features:

Dynamic Filters: Users can filter data by day of the week (weekday/weekend) and building type (Commercial, Industrial, Residential).

Energy Consumption Trends: A time-series analysis of total energy consumption over different days.

Total Energy Consumption by Building Type: A pie chart visualizing the percentage contribution of each building type.

Average Energy Consumption: A gauge chart showing the average consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

Energy Consumption vs. Temperature: A correlation between temperature changes and energy usage.

📊 Dashboard Visuals:

Bar Chart: Energy consumption trends for each building type.

Pie Chart: Breakdown of total energy usage by building type.

Line Chart: Energy consumption over a week.

Gauge Chart: Average energy consumption.

Stacked Area Chart: Relationship between temperature and energy consumption.

📈 Key Insights

Residential buildings consume 33.31% of the total energy, followed by Industrial (30.66%) and Commercial (36.03%).

Energy consumption tends to decrease over the week, with the highest usage observed on Friday & Saturday.

A strong correlation between temperature fluctuations and energy consumption.
